# Real Time Chat Application


Utilized React for the frontend, Vite for a fast build setup, and Firebase for backend services such as Firestore for real-time database, Authentication for user management, and Storage for file handling 

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
